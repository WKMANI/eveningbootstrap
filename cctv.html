</p>
<ol>
    <li>Spy cameras</li>
    <li>General Cameras</li>
</ol>

<img src="images/spycameras.jpg" alt="Spy Cameras" width="50%" height="150">
<p>
    As the name suggests these are cameras that are installed to SPY on unsuspecting individuals. These cameras are designed to blend in with the environment and they capture a great deal of information. Most of the request that Fix Kenya has received for this kind of cameras have been in situations where there is mistrust between spouses. We are fully aware though that spy cameras may be utilized for various reasons. Fix Kenya shall analyze the situation, conduct a site survey then we will advise you on what the best camera for the job is.

<h5>General Cameras</h5>

<p>
    There are two categories of general cameras: the Dome Cameras and the Bullet cameras. The dome cameras are mostly used for indoor surveillance and the bullet cameras are mostly used for outdoor surveillance.
